## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
Run the SQL commands in `database/reviews_table.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# Copy and paste the contents of database/reviews_table.sql
# This will create all necessary tables, views, and policies
```

### Step 2: API Endpoints
The following API endpoints are automatically created:

- **POST** `/api/reviews/create` - Create a new review
- **GET** `/api/reviews/get` - Fetch reviews for a car
- **DELETE** `/api/reviews/delete` - Delete a review

### Step 3: Components
The review system consists of these React components:

- **`Reviews.js`** - Main container component
- **`ReviewForm.js`** - Form for creating/editing reviews
- **`ReviewList.js`** - Display list of reviews with statistics

### Step 4: Integration
The Reviews component is already integrated into the car detail page (`pages/cars/[id].js`).

## 📍 Location in App

### Where Reviews Appear
Reviews are displayed on the **Car Detail Page** (`/cars/[id]`) right after the car information and before the "Discuss This Car" button.

### Why This Location?
